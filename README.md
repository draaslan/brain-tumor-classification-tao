Brain tumor classification from MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) images is crucial in medical diagnostics. Automated and accurate classification can assist radiologists in diagnosing and categorizing tumors, which aids in deciding appropriate treatment regimens. 

NVIDIA TAO Toolkit offers developers, data scientists, and researchers a platform to build AI models for various applications, including medical imaging. This tutorial will mention how to classify brain tumors using the TAO Toolkit.

[!WARNING]  
This dataset and tutorial is not prepared for diagnostic usage! The aim is demonstrating features of TAO Toolkit in medical imaging.
